<h2>Sindbad the Sailor sold 66 silver spoons to the Sultan of Samarkand. The selling was
quite easy; but delivering was complicated. The items were transported over land, passing
through several towns and villages. Each town and village demanded an entry toll. There
were no tolls for leaving. The toll for entering a village was simply one item.
The toll for entering a town was one piece per 20 items carried. For example, to enter a
town carrying 70 items, you had to pay 4 items as toll. The towns and villages were situated
strategically between rocks, swamps and rivers, so you could not avoid them.</h2>
